This is a package for evaluating the prolate spheroidal wave functions of order 0 and
integer characteristic exponents.  Its principal claim-to-fame is that it allows
for the evaluation of these functions in time independent of the bandlimit and
characteristic exponent.  

The package comprises the following files:

1.  The file utils.f90 contains simple utility routines for printing, sorting and
the like.

2.  The file prolates.f90 contains code for constructing and manipulating
expansions of the angular prolate spheroidal wave functions of the first kind of
order 0 and characteristic values in series of Legendre polynomials.  It uses the 
Rokhlin-Osipov method to compute said expansions and the well-known three-term 
recurrence relations to evaluate them.  

This is an implementation of the classical algorithm for evaluating the spheriodal
wave functions and its running time depends on the bandlimit, characteristic exponent
and order.

3.   The file chebyshev.f90 contains code for constructing an manipulating
univariate Chebyshev expansions.

5.  The file prolates_phase.f90 contains code for constructing nonoscillatory
phase functions which represents the solutions of the spheroidal wave equation
of order 0 for specified values of the paramters chi and gamma.

This code is capable of evaluating the prolate spheroidal wave functions
of order 0 in time independent of bandlimit  and characteristic exponent assuming
the value of the parameter chi in the spheroidal wave equation corresponding
to the desired value of the characteristic exponent is known.

6.  The file prolates_exps.f90 contains code for constructing expansions of
the parameter chi and some related quantities as functions of the alternative 
parameter

    xi = ( 2/pi psi(0; gamma) - 1 ) ,

where psi(x; gamma) is the nonoscillatory phase function for the reduced
spheroidal wave equation.  Here, the order is taken to be 0.  The expansions
could be extended to the case of nonzero orders, but they would be become
quite large.

7.  The file build_exps.f90 contains code for constructing the expansions
used by the code in fast_prolates.f90.  

IMPORTANT: THIS CODE SHOULD BE EXECUTED IN EXTENDED PRECISION REAL*10
OR REAL*16 ARTIHMETIC

8.  The file experiments1.f90 contains code for performing the experiments
discussed in the paper "An O(1) algorithm for the numerical evaluation
of the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalues of the spheroidal wave functions
of order zero" and for constructing most of the figures which appear in 
that paper.

9.  The file experiments2.f90 contains code for performing the experiments
discussed in the paper "On the numerical evaluation of the prolate spheroidal 
wave functions of order zero." and for making 


10.  The file spheroidal.f90 contains code for constructing and manipulating
expansions of the angular prolate spheroidal wave functions of the first kind of
integer orders and characteristic values in series of associated Legendre
polynomials.  It uses the Rokhlin-Osipov method to compute said expansions and the
well-known three-term recurrence relations to evaluate them.  

11.  The file spheroidal_phase.f90 contains code for constructing nonoscillatory
phase functions which represents the solutions of the spheroidal wave equation
for specified values of the paramters chi, gamma and dmu.  

This code is capable of evaluating the prolate spheroidal wave functions
in time independent of bandlimit, order and characteristic exponent assuming
the value of the parameter chi in the spheroidal wave equation corresponding
to the desired value of the characteristic exponent is known.
